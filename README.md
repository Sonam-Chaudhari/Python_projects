# My first python project

This is my first project on python which is about speeling checking. this project checks the speeeling in line and correct it 
<br>
If you are checking this then thank you for reading and suggest me anu changes or new project idea that I can work on.
<br>
Here's fun fact when I run this code for firts time after removing all the error , The first senetence I wage was "Helo I am dataa engineeer" It returned Help I am data engineer. 
<br>
When I tried 2nd time for same sentence just changing the the spelll of "hello" to "hellw" so that it can give "hello" , it gave me "hell I am data engineer. Even Python roast engineer in its own style." 
<br>
So This was all about my first Python project , yhere is way more to learn and any suggestion would be taken as constructive feedback, thankyou.
